## Technical details
- Mainly used HTML and CSS
- Used a little bit of Javascript inside a script tag in the HTML file

## Technical challenges
- A challenge I came across was making the embedded video responsive
- Also had a bit of trouble making the form responsive

## Improvements I would make
- I would use more Javascript and DOM manipulation next time but I wanted to keep it simple using mainly HTML and CSS
- I would also add more CSS animations
